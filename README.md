# Decision-Making Analysis Using EEG Signals

This project investigates **human decision-making patterns** using EEG (Electroencephalography) signals.  
It explores how different brain regions synchronize during decision tasks, using frequency-domain features, correlation analysis, and clustering methods.

## üß© Overview

The notebook `Decision_making_with_eeg_dataset_updated.ipynb` performs:
1. **Data Loading** ‚Äì Reads `.set` EEG files using MNE and extracts six key electrodes:
   - **Occipital:** O1, O2  
   - **Parietal:** P7, P8  
   - **Prefrontal:** FP1, FP2  

2. **Signal Processing** ‚Äì Applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and selects frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Gamma) for analysis.

3. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Builds **region-level features** by combining left/right channel magnitudes within each brain region.

4. **Cross-Subject Correlation** ‚Äì Computes **Pearson** and **Spearman** correlations between subjects to measure inter-brain synchrony.

5. **Clustering** ‚Äì Uses **K-Means** to group subjects with similar neural decision-making signatures.

6. **Visualization** ‚Äì Plots frequency spectra, correlation heatmaps, and clustering patterns.

## üß† Research Goal

To uncover **neural synchronization patterns** during decision-making tasks and compare:
- **Occipital** (visual processing),
- **Parietal** (integration and attention),
- **Prefrontal** (executive and control) regions.
